DISSECTING THE MARKET

This electron app, runs python script, that loops over DOW JONES historic data from the last 30 years under some condition.
Then return the result to the user.
The idea is to implement a form so users can set their own conditions.
Also it needs to be tidied up. But am having some problems with paths.
